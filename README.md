# Workout Calendar Generator

This Python package generates a personalized monthly workout calendar. It exports an `.ics` file that you can easily import into Google Calendar, helping you stay on track with your fitness goals.

The generated calendar includes strength training routines (with a focus on calisthenics) and running sessions of varied intensities.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Customizable for Any Month:** Generate a calendar for any month of the year by entering a number (1-12).
- **Balanced Routine:** Automatically balances running sessions (tempo, distance, and long runs) with strength workouts.
- **Dynamic Schedule:** Rotates strength sets and running workouts based on the day of the month.
- **Google Calendar Integration:** Outputs an `.ics` file you can import directly into Google Calendar or other calendar apps.
